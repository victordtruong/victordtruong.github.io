The storm raged outside, rain lashing against the windows of the old cabin. Amelia clutched the rusted lantern she’d found in the attic earlier that evening, its glass cracked and its brass frame tarnished with time. Something about it had drawn her, though she couldn’t explain why. Now, as the lights flickered and the power failed, she was glad she’d brought it downstairs.

She struck a match and lit the lantern. A dim, eerie glow filled the room, casting long, flickering shadows on the wooden walls. The flame inside seemed almost alive, dancing with unnatural vigor.

As she set the lantern on the table, a gust of wind burst through the cracks in the windows, extinguishing every candle in the room except the lantern’s flame. Amelia froze, her eyes fixed on the glass. For a moment, she thought she saw a face in the flame—pale and distorted, with hollow eyes and a gaping mouth.

She blinked, and it was gone.

The room grew colder. Her breath became visible in the frigid air. The storm’s howls outside seemed to warp, turning into a low, mournful wail. Amelia’s heart raced as she backed away from the lantern. It was just her imagination, she told herself. The storm was playing tricks on her.

But then the whispers began.

At first, they were faint, barely audible over the storm. A single word repeated again and again: *“Leave.”* Amelia spun around, expecting to see someone behind her, but the room was empty. Her pulse thundered in her ears as she turned back to the lantern.

The flame had changed. It was no longer orange but a sickly green, casting an unnatural hue over the room. The shadows on the walls seemed to move of their own accord, twisting and writhing like living things.

And then the voice came, deep and guttural, echoing from within the lantern itself. “You should not have lit me.”

Amelia stumbled backward, knocking over a chair. The lantern’s flame flared brighter, illuminating the room with a blinding green light. She shielded her eyes, but when she lowered her hand, she saw them—figures standing in the corners of the room, their bodies translucent and flickering like static on an old television.

They were staring at her.

One stepped forward, its face half-formed and grotesque. “You have called us,” it rasped. “Now, you must join us.”

Amelia screamed and ran for the door, but it slammed shut on its own, the sound reverberating through the cabin. The whispers turned into a cacophony, voices overlapping, shouting, crying, and laughing in a maddening symphony. She clawed at the door, her fingernails splintering against the wood, but it wouldn’t budge.

The figures closed in, their cold, spectral hands reaching for her. The lantern’s light pulsed, faster and faster, until it consumed everything in a blinding flash.

When the storm passed, the cabin stood silent. The lantern sat on the table, its flame extinguished. The room was empty, save for a faint whisper that lingered in the air: *“Leave...”*

The next morning, hikers found the cabin abandoned. On the table lay the lantern, its glass pristine and its brass frame gleaming as if new. One of the hikers, curious, reached out to pick it up.

The whispers began again.
