The moon hung low in the December sky, casting a pale glow over the Frostwood countryside. Julia walked briskly down the overgrown path leading to her grandmother’s old house, the frigid air nipping at her cheeks. She had inherited the place six months ago, but it was her first time visiting.

As she approached the house, her flashlight caught the glint of something in the bushes. A pair of glowing, amber eyes stared back at her. Julia froze, her breath catching in her throat. The figure stepped into view—a large black dog, its fur matted and thin, but its eyes burned with an unnatural intensity.

"Hey there, boy," Julia murmured, extending a hand.

The dog tilted its head but didn’t move closer. Instead, it let out a low, mournful whine before turning and vanishing into the darkness.

The encounter left Julia uneasy, but she chalked it up to her nerves. She entered the house, flicking on the old, dim lights. Dust coated every surface, and the air smelled faintly of mildew. She dropped her bag on the couch and wandered into the living room, where a portrait hung above the fireplace.

It was a painting of her grandmother, standing in front of the house with a proud smile. At her side sat a black dog, its amber eyes instantly recognizable. Julia’s stomach dropped.

“That’s impossible,” she whispered. Her grandmother’s dog, Max, had died years before Julia was even born. 

A sudden scratching noise broke the silence, coming from the back door. Julia’s heart raced as she grabbed the flashlight and crept toward the sound. Swinging the door open, she found nothing but the stillness of the winter night.

But then she heard it—a soft panting behind her.

Spinning around, Julia’s flashlight illuminated the black dog standing in the hallway. It didn’t growl or bark, but its unblinking eyes seemed to bore into her soul. 

“Max?” she whispered. The name came out unbidden, as though it had been pulled from her lips.

The dog whined and turned, walking toward the staircase. Julia hesitated but felt compelled to follow. Max ascended the stairs silently, his ghostly paws making no sound on the creaking wood. He stopped in front of a closed door at the end of the hallway and stared at her, waiting.

Julia’s hand trembled as she reached for the doorknob. The moment she touched it, an icy chill ran up her arm, and she pulled away. The dog let out a low growl, its glowing eyes narrowing.

“Okay, okay,” she stammered, and turned the knob.

The door swung open to reveal a small, dusty room. At its center lay a tattered dog bed, and beside it, a wooden box with her grandmother’s initials carved into the lid. Julia picked up the box, its weight heavy in her hands. As she opened it, a wave of cold air rushed out, and the contents made her stomach churn—a faded leash, a collar, and an old photograph of her grandmother holding Max as a puppy.

Behind her, the growling grew louder.

Julia turned to find Max standing inches away, his body shimmering with an otherworldly light. His growl was no longer canine—it was something deeper, almost human. She stumbled backward, clutching the box to her chest.

The dog lunged, but instead of striking her, it dissolved into a swirling mist that enveloped the room. Voices filled the air—whispers of her grandmother’s name, of warnings unheeded. The box grew heavier in her hands, and an unseen force seemed to push her toward the window.

“Release it,” the voices hissed. “Release him.”

Terrified, Julia threw the box out the window. The instant it shattered on the ground below, the whispers stopped, and the mist dissipated. The room fell silent, the chill lifting as though it had never been there.

---

The next morning, Julia found the box’s remains in the yard. The collar and leash were gone, leaving only the faded photograph, now burned around the edges. On the back was a message she hadn’t seen before, scrawled in her grandmother’s handwriting:

*"He must never be bound again."*

Julia left the house that day and never returned. But on cold winter nights, those who wander too close to the old property sometimes see a black dog with glowing amber eyes, standing silent and still, watching from the shadows.

**The End**
